# Scenario:

Delegate in C#

## Scenario Description:

- This project creates a Coffee Machine that can make different types of coffee using the following delegate methods:

	- Custom Delegate,
	- Action Delegate,
	- Func Delegate.

## Features:

- Delegates in C# are similar to function pointers in C or C++.
- A delegate is a reference type variable that holds the reference to a method.
- The reference can be changed at runtime.
- Delegates are especially used for implementing events and the call-back methods.
- All delegates are implicitly derived from the System.Delegate class.
